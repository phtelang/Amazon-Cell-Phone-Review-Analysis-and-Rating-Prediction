## Amazon Cell Phone Review Analysis and Rating Predictions

In this project, I analyzed Amazon cell phone reviews and predicted the rating for the cell phones using the reviews. This dataset focuses on both unlocked and locked carriers, and scoped on ten brands: ASUS, Apple, Google, HUAWEI, Motorola, Nokia, OnePlus, Samsung, Sony, and Xiaomi. Using the data, I analyzed the reviews, review words, brand and date-wise review differences and predicted the cell phone ratings using reviews. 
I used four models for prediction: LogisticRegression(), RandomForestClassifier(), MultinomialNB(), LinearSVC(). 
- Logistic Regression algorithm is used when the relationship between the features and the target values is nonlinear. This means we need a function that can perform a nonlinear transformation of the input features. The prediction is made on the probability value given by the model. 
- Random Forest algorithm construct a multitude of decision trees at training time and output the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. They use ensembling which combines the predictions of multiple models to create a more accurate final prediction. One of the major advantages of random forests over single decision trees is that they tend to overfit less. 
- A Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model thatâ€™s used for classification task. Using Bayes theorem, we can find the probability of A happening, given that B has occurred. The assumption made here is that the predictors/features are independent. Hence it is called naive.
- Support Vector Classifiers tries to find the best hyperplane to separate the different classes by maximizing the distance between sample points and the hyperplane.

There are two files in this dataset: 
1. Cell phone information data and 
2. Cell phone review data. 
The dataset can be downloaded from __[here](https://www.kaggle.com/grikomsn/amazon-cell-phones-reviews)__.

### Summary of Results
1. Majority of the reviews have less than 100 words.
2. Samsung is the most popular cell phone brand with most number of models.
3. Predominant positive words in the reviews: great, love, brand new, works great, negative words: issue, problem, bad, still.
4. Majority of popular 20 frequent words are positive.
5. We can see that Mototola, Samsung and ASUS have most of the ratings above 3, while brands like Nokia, Sony, Apple and Google have ratings distributed from 2 to 5.
6. Review count has consistently increased from 2010 to August 2019 and reduced after that. Maximum number of reviews are seen in July 2019.
7. An accuracy of 73% was achieved for the cell phone rating predictions using Linear SVC Model.
